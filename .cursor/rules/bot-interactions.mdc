# Bot Interaction Patterns

## Message Handling
The bot responds to two types of interactions:
1. Direct mentions (@bot_name)
2. Replies to bot messages

## Response Format
- Regular responses are sent as standard Discord messages
- Error responses use Discord embeds with:
  - Title: Error
  - Description: "I can't think straight right now. Please try again later, or tell Retr0gr4d3 to wake me up"
  - Footer: Link to https://retr0.gr4d3.uk/

## Message Processing Flow
1. Message received
2. Check if message is a mention or reply
3. Extract user message content
4. Process through LLM backend
5. Send response or error message

## Error Handling
The bot implements error handling for:
- API connection failures
- Invalid responses
- Rate limiting
- Authentication errors

All errors should be logged for debugging purposes while maintaining user-friendly error messages.
